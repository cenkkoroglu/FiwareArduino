# FiwareArduino

For comunication with arduino this tutorial uses Orion Context Broker of the Fiware tecnologies.
The Fiware platform include open source software enablers that allow easy
development of Smart cities and IoT solutions.

The Orion Context Broker is an implementation of the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker GE, 
providing the NGSI9 and NGSI10 interfaces. 
This interfaces uses the REST-API to accept update and query commands for
wirte and read operations. The following figure presents the schematic architecture 
of our tutorial, where Arduino sends NGSI notifications by ESP8266 module to Orion
Context Broker allowing applications subscriptions.
